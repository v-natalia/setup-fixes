# Le Wagon Setup Fixes

Hey teachers, during the setup for Windows, one step is not working as it should:
## [Connecting VS Code to Ubuntu] (https://github.com/lewagon/setup/blob/master/windows.md#connecting-vs-code-to-ubuntu)
It should connect actomatically to WSL-Ubuntu but it doesn't. To fix this you need to install manually the extension WSL.
