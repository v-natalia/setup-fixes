# Le Wagon Setup Fixes

Hey teachers, during the setup for Windows, one step is not working as it should:
## [Connecting VS Code to Ubuntu](https://github.com/lewagon/setup/blob/master/windows.md#connecting-vs-code-to-ubuntu)
It should connect actomatically to WSL-Ubuntu but it doesn't. To fix this you need to install manually the extension WSL.
For that, open VS Code and go to the small square that allows to install extensions, search for Remote-WSL and install it (image for reference).
